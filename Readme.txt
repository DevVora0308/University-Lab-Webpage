# Lab Webpage Project

This project is a fully responsive website for a laboratory, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated with a contact form. It is designed to showcase various courses, resources, and faculty information. 

## Project Overview

The Lab Webpage consists of multiple sections, including a banner, courses, mentors, and a contact form. It demonstrates clean UI/UX design principles, cross-browser compatibility, and mobile responsiveness.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap to ensure a seamless experience across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Custom CSS Styling:** Enhanced visual elements with custom `style.css` to complement Bootstrap's layout.
- **Interactive Contact Form:** Implemented a working contact form using JavaScript and form validation to ensure proper input handling.
- **Image Galleries:** Utilizes a dynamic image hover effect (`imagehover.min.css`) to showcase different course offerings.
- **FontAwesome Integration:** Includes FontAwesome icons for a modern, professional look across the webpage.

### Technical Stack

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Semantic HTML and modular CSS are used for clean, maintainable, and accessible web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized Bootstrap for the grid layout and responsive design, ensuring the page adapts across different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript & jQuery**: Added functionality like smooth scrolling, easing animations, and form validation.
- **FontAwesome**: Integrated FontAwesome for consistent and scalable icons.
- **Git**: Version control to track changes and collaborate efficiently.


### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Lab_Webpage-main

2. Open index.html: Launch the webpage by opening the index.html file in your preferred browser.

### Contact Form Setup

 - The contact form is powered by contactform.js, which ensures input validation and smooth form submission. To set up the form, ensure that the backend handles the form POST request for the email submission (refer to contactform/Readme.txt for more details).
